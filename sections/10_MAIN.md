# Drillbridge

Wouldn't it be nice to drillthrough from Essbase to the underyling detail that supports that data? It
sure would be! Saxifrage Systems' software, Drillbridge, makes drilling to data in a relational
database very easy. 

Why not Essbase Studio? Essbase Studio is a solid product, but if you already have cubes being created and
maintained manually or with tools such as EPMA, switching over to Essbase Studio could be an impossibly
large task.

This is where the Drillbridge comes in. Drillbridge augments an existing cube at the levels you specify and
serves as a central jumping off point (a bridge, if you will) that gives you flexibility with respect to what
you want users to be able to drill through to.
